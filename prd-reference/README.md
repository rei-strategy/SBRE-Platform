# SBRE Landing Page

Marketing page for SBRE Connect™ — a verified vendor network for small business and real estate teams.

## Getting started

1. From this folder, run a simple static server (e.g. `python3 -m http.server 4173`) or just open `index.html` directly in a browser.
2. Edit `index.html` to update copy/sections, tweak visuals in `styles.css`, and adjust interactive behavior in `script.js`.
3. The contact form submission is mocked client-side; replace the handler in `script.js` with a real endpoint when you’re ready.
